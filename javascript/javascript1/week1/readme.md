# Readme

// 1 - Create two variables called yearOfBirth and yearFuture. Assign these your own age and a future year. What type will these two variables be? Now calculate the age and store that in a variable called age. Log out this string: "You will be 40 years old in 2027". With 40 being the result of the age variable and 2027 being the yearFuture variable. (Hint use string concatenation)

// 2 - Like before lets create three variables but this time we call them dogYearOfBirth, dogYearFuture and dogYear. We add an extra variable called shouldShowResultInDogYears. If it is true we should show the result in dog years, if it is false we should show it in human years. What do we call this type of variable? Now log this string out: "Your dog will be 10 human years old in 2027" or "Your dog will be 70 dog years old in 2027"

// 3 - Housey pricey (A house price estimator)
// Your friend Peter is considering a house that is 8m wide, 10m deep and 10m high. The garden size is 100m2. The house costs 2.500.000. Your friend Julia is considering a house that is 5m wide, 11m deep and 8m high. The garden size is 70m2. This house costs 1.000.000.

// Figure out if Peter and Julia are paying too much or too little using Javascript and the formula specified above.
