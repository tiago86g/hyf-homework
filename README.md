At HackYourFuture classes, I have exposed myself to different technologies from Front end to Databases till Back end.

## HTML/CSS:
This was the first module where I learnt to work with HTML and also familiarized myself with CSS. I was exposed to HTML semantic tags and also built a form where I could use all the concepts learnt throughout the module.

## Javascript:
The Javascript module was the most intense part of my experience in HYF and I learnt a lot during those 10-11 weeks. 

## Databases:
In this module I learnt how to build tables, insert data and also understanding and building ER diagram. I create some table structures for the app that I was about to build in Node module.

## Node.js:
In this module I was exposed to all concepts that work in the backend. I learnt to build API's, different routings and connection to DB and extracting data. I developed a Meal-sharing app where we could create meals, reserve a meal, delete meals and also update meals. I also learnt to deploy the application in Heroku.

## React.js:
In this module, I learnt to think and design the front end UI based on the react way. I got exposed to decide on how I should think about components, how I should divide the components and how I should render them. I also learnt to handle the state and props and passing them to different components. I tested my knowledge by building a To-do app, Github users search app and giphy search app.
